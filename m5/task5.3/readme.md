TASK5.3
Part1
# 1. How many states could has a process in Linux?

5
- R -> Running 
- S -> Sleeping, Interruptible 
- D -> Sleeping, Uninterruptible 
- T -> Stopped, or Traced 
- Z -> Zombie

# 2. Examine the pstree command. Make output (highlight) the chain (ancestors) of the current process.

# 3. What is a proc file system?

It is a special directory in UNIX system. Where system users and programms can have access to all sort of information related to computer and core state.  
It is also a virtual folder which is generated on fly. 
This approach in reciving and managing information in UNIX systems is born from main UNIX concept. Where everything is a file. 

# 4. Print information about the processor (its type, supported technologies, etc.).

# 5. Use the ps command to get information about the process. The information should be as follows: the owner of the process, the arguments with which the process was launched for execution, the group owner of this process, etc.

# 6. How to define kernel processes and user processes?

It is the same as the difference between a process and a thread. 
Every process have it's own virtual memory enviroment, while threads may share it. 

Therfore a kernel process is running only and exclusivly in the kernel assigned memory (and is unaccesible from outside) 

# 7. Print the list of processes to the terminal. Briefly describe the statuses of the processes. What condition are they in, or can they be arriving in?

![alt text](images/4.png)

We can see their status on the S collum.

# 8. Display only the processes of a specific user.

# 9. What utilities can be used to analyze existing running tasks (by analyzing the help for the ps command)?

``` ps aux ``` ? 

# 10. What information does top command display?

Current system processes. Dynamically. In real time.

# 12. Display the processes of the specific user using the top command.
``` top -u *username* ```

# 12. What interactive commands can be used to control the top command? Give a couple of examples.

![alt text](images/7.png)

# 13. Sort the contents of the processes window using various parameters (for example, the amount of processor time taken up, etc.)
``` top -o TIME+ ```

# 14. Concept of priority, what commands are used to set priority?

The main utility for this kind of operations is ``` nice ``` 

``` renice -n -*value* -p *process PID* ```


# 15. Can I change the priority of a process using the top command? If so, how?

``` top ``` followed by ```r``` (renice) and after we must insert the PID, with the next value. 

# 16. Examine the kill command. How to send with the kill command process control signal? Give an example of commonly used signals.

``` kill *PID ``` 
Sends a SIGTERM signal to the process.

# 17. Commands jobs, fg, bg, nohup. What are they for? Use the sleep, yes command to demonstrate the process control mechanism with fg, bg.
To monitor processes and redirect their input/output. 
From background to foreground and vice versa.

Fg is for foreground, while bg is for background

## Part2

# 1. Check the implementability of the most frequently used OPENSSH commands in the MS Windows operating system. (Description of the expected result of the commands + screenshots: command â€“ result should be presented)

![alt text](images/11.png)

I also used scp copy many times before.

# 2. Implement basic SSH settings to increase the security of the client-server connection (at least

![alt text](images/12.png)

# 3. List the options for choosing keys for encryption in SSH. Implement 3 of them.



# 4. Implement port forwarding for the SSH client from the host machine to the guest Linux virtual machine behind NAT.



# 5*. Intercept (capture) traffic (tcpdump, wireshark) while authorizing the remote client on the server using ssh, telnet, rlogin. Analyze the result.
