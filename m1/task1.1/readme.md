It was interesting. Learning all of these new commands, creating new branches, merging them, and resolving those yet "simple" conflicts.
This time, I had only one issue with merging into main. Didn't understood at first, that I must in fact checkout to main, to merge into main. 

I hope that I got this interesting logic behind it. 
And of course, this is only the beginning.

# Dev Ops Explanation

From my perspective, DevOps engineer is a person, who is assisting a software developing company in all of the company's software developing stages. Therefore, a DevOps specialist must be an expert in nearly every IT science field. And that's why this is so cool!

His main duty is: to increase software developing/deploying/testing/releasing time and mostly assuring and increasing a better reliability in all of the involved (related to computer software) processes.
